								Why is there a RotairAO_Screening and a RotairimsAO_Screening?  Same with the Note business rules.
								<br>
								<br>
								In the original code we had "change tracking."  This was a protocol developed by the consultant that worked well.  During the
								save of an object a copy of the original record would get written to a changes table.  So now we had a history of all the
								changes made to a table.  It was, however, thought that it could not work with the new object design since the actual
								save method was buried deep in the framework and was inaccessible.  A suggestion to use triggers to capture the changes was not
								accepted.  So our own object model was created.  This consisted of rotAppObject, rotAppObjectCollection and rotAppLockingObject.
								An example of one of these objects is RotairAO_Screening.  It was then decided to use triggers for the change tracking.  I called
								this process "history tracking" to differentiate between the two co-existing protocols.  In order to remove the original model I 
								needed to start using the newer objects along with the older objects until I could remove all references to the prior design.  
								So RotairimsAO_Screening is the new design and will eventually replace RotairAO_Screening.  When all references to the older design 
								are gone RotairAO_Screening should be deleted and RotairimsAO_Screening should be renamed to RotairAO_Screening.
								<br>
								<br>
								After working with the vendor's objects for awhile I learned that we may be able use the original change tracking and the vendor
								supplied objects.  But we already have two versions of change/history tracking objects, I see no reason to introduce a third.  Plus I 
								still believe the triggers are the way to go even though we have had some problems with the product not using our custom objects.  It has
								not been determined if the problems would go away with my latest possible solution.
